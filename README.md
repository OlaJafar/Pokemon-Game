# 🎮 Pokémon Coin Collector Game

A C# Windows Forms game where the player controls a Pokémon character and collects coins while avoiding a rotating stick obstacle.

## 🧩 Game Idea

The game features a stick that rotates around the center of the screen.  
Its **direction** and **rotation speed** change periodically, increasing the difficulty over time.

The player must collect as many coins as possible before the rotating stick touches the Pokémon character.  
If a collision occurs, the game ends.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This project was implemented using:

- **C#**
- **Windows Forms**

### 📐 Computer Graphics Concepts Applied

The game was built from scratch using fundamental computer graphics algorithms and transformation formulas, including:

- ✏️ DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm for line drawing  
- ⭕ Circle Drawing Algorithm  
- 🔄 Rotation transformation formulas  
- 🔍 Scaling transformation formulas  
- 📍 Translation transformation formulas  

All shapes and movements were manually calculated and rendered without relying on external graphics engines.
